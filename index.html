    <h3>1991 THE FIRST APPLE LAPTOP COMPUTERS</h3>
    <p>In 1991, Apple released the first three PowerBooks: the high-end PowerBook 100, the more powerful PowerBook 140, and the high- end PowerBook 170, the only one with an active matrix display.</p>
    <p>These laptops caused a stir in the tech industry due to their compact dark grey cases, built-in trackball, and the innovative positioning of the keyboard which left room for palm-rests. These were features that hadn’t been seen in previous laptops. The user-friendly layout of these PowerBooks helped to set out the future for Apple laptop computers. Basically, the PowerBook’s series became the standard layout all future notebook PCs would eventually follow.</p>
    <p>These PowerBooks from Apple were met with positive reviews, the first series taking 40% of all laptop sales upon release. Despite their popularity, Apple laptops struggled with <strong>overheating problems</strong>.</p>
